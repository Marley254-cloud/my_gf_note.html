    <h1>Hey Baby❤</h1>
    <p>This is a little note just for you. I hope it makes you smile today😂!</p>
    <p>Babe, I don't know how you do it, but you make my world so much brighter just by being in it. I could be having the most stressful day, and the moment I think about you or hear from you, everything instantly feels lighter.</p>
    <p>You're literally my favorite person, my safe space, and my biggest source of happiness. I am lucky to have you🌹❤.</p>
    <p>I promise to always support you😚🤗, annoy you😂, cheer you in every little thing, and love you endlessly😍❤.</p>
    <p>You've got my whole heart😇❤and honestly, I wouldn't want it any other way.❤❤</p>
    <p>Love, Mary Mutheu❤.</p>
